# Gulp Config Examples

A few examples of how to load configurations for a gulp build from config files.



## JavaScript based configs
You need to create and export a module to use JavaScript based configs, but you can add comments to the file and you don't need an additional module.

## JSON based configs
You need the fs package for this, but the config file is a simple JSON file. On the down side, you can't easily comment a JSON file.
